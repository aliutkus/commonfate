The Common Fate Transform is based on a signal representation that
divides a complex spectrogram into a grid of patches of arbitrary size.
These complex patches are then processed by a two-dimensional discrete
Fourier transform, forming a tensor representation which reveals
spectral and temporal modulation textures.
